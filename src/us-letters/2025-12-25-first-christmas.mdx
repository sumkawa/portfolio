When I first teased you about being a ‘frat boy’, I had no idea how quickly I’d feel this connection. Every moment since has been nothing but amazing - our movie nights, all the wonderful dinners you’ve taken me to, & even the little moments in between. Summit this letter is for you. Sometimes, words seem so small compared to what I feel for you, but I’ll try my best to capture the affection that fills my heart. You know what else fills my heart? your smile, your warm hugs, your smell. The first night we met I was hesitant to kiss you at the club because I usually don’t kiss strangers. But, I had this gut feeling that I’ll see you again & something may spark between us.

The first interactions we had still replays in my head. Summit I know this letter may not be perfect, but it’s honest, & I just wanted to express how much I appreciate you & how excited I am to be your girlfriend. I’m looking forward to more tism moments, our philosophies in life, our taste in food. I am so excited to discover more about each other. So, consider this letter a little bookmark in our story I’m looking forward to all the chapters ahead. As they say in korean “기대해” which means ‘look forward’.
