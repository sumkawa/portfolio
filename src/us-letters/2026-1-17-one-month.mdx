one month with you feels both quiet & extraordinary in the best way possible. It’s strange how time can feel so gentle when it’s spent with someone who makes you feel seen. In just a few weeks, you’ve become someone I look forward to someone who brings calm where there used to be noise, & warmth where I didn’t even realize there was distance.

Happy 1 month! Sorry this is corny… This letter is going to be super corny.

I am so happy & thankful everyday that you chose me to be yours. I still can’t get over the fact we met at the club. Usually when people meet at the club it ends up as a one time thing & I’d never see you again but with you I get to see you again.

I feel like my letter last time was a bit vague but this letter is a tad bit better. In Mongolian they say best of 3. The lucky number in Mongolian culture is 3. So… sticking to that tradition I’m making you 3 promises.

When things get hard in our lives or between us I’m here for you & here to take care of you in every situation

I’ll care for you no matter how far we are from each other. I will find my ways :)

Stop hiding what bothers you & me because I will keep that promise of communicating & building my trust with you.

These are my promises that I’m going to promise you forever.

The night I was drunk & telling you how I felt were my insecurities that I’ve had for years. I know we both come into this relationship carrying our own worries. You’ve shared how the gaps & distance can make you anxious now opening up & committing doesn’t always feel easy. And I’ll admit, I’ve had my own quiet fears too - wondering if I’m too much but I have expressed my concerns & how I’m feeling. What matters most to me is that these fears exist - it’s about how we talked about them. The night I opened up, even imperfectly, & unplanned. It felt heard & I think we both set the tone about how we trust you alot more.

I don’t want to rush the future or live in fear of it. I want to live here, in the moment - where our chemistry exists, where our connection feels natural, where we’re learning each other slowly & intentionally. I believe that love doesn’t disappear just because of time or distance. I think it stays when two people keep meeting each other with patience & care.

Summit I really like you. I don’t need perfection from you or us. I don’t need certainty all the time. I just want honesty, presence, & the willingness to grow together at our own pace & right now, that feels like enough.

Thank you for being someone I feel safe opening up to. Thank you for being patient with me as I learn how to do the same. I’m really grateful for you & for us, exactly as we are in this moment.

I’m so grateful you welcomed me with open arms.

As the 3 promises I’ve made I’m going to stick to it.

I’m looking forward to what’s ahead.

Lots of love & care
Aguun :)
