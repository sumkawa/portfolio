Happy 3 Months Summit! 

It’s been only 3 months with you, but somehow feels like so much more. In such a short time, you’ve become such an important part of my life. What we’ve built already feels meaningful and real, and that makes my stomach feel butterflies every time I think about you. I love that we’re growing together, leaning each other more deeply everyday, and creating something that feels steady and genuine. 

I feel like meeting your family and seeing the family side in you made me fall in love with you even more. The love you have for you family is adorable. 

I know Friday was cooked. I am still sorry for what happened and it was all because of my actions and something I should’ve fixed. Summit I love you so much that the smallest thing I do  for you I put a lot of effort and thought into it just like this message. I know I broke down crying but it was just out of love and care because seeing you hurt and worried is something I never want to see. I am really glad we had that talk and decided to create those agreements. 

Summit I promise from now on and until forever. 
<br/>
1. Tell you EVERYTHING 
<br/>
2. NO PETTINESS (probs misspelt) 
<br />

But above all of the other ones I know that honesty is the best answer to everything. I love you so much and I hope that everyday we grow stronger and communicate. 

Happy 3 month anniversary my love. I am so happy I get to call you mine.

And I know this trip was 15% a bit cooked. Thank you for my long distance boyfriend (you). Love is not perfect, but it is still love. At the end of the day, I realized that I am so deeply cared for and it is time I start acknowledging that. 

At the end of the day I know that I am not alone I have someone that deeply cares for me even though he may be thousands of miles away ❤️
